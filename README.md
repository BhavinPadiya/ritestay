# Ritestay – Custom WordPress Theme

Ritestay is a clean, minimal custom WordPress theme designed and developed from scratch for learning and demonstration purposes. Built with a focus on real-world hospitality and local business use-cases, this theme is fully responsive, uses the Bootstrap grid system, supports custom menus (including multi-level dropdowns), and is ready for further extension (bookings, custom post types, more).

## Features

- Custom navigation menu with multi-level dropdown support (Rooms submenu).
- Responsive design: seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Admin-driven dynamic page creation and linking.
- Blog posts displayed in a Bootstrap-powered grid for easy, modern browsing.
- Simple search bar included in the header.
- Minimal, clean appearance—ideal for business, hotel, or portfolio sites.
- Screenshots provided below demonstrate desktop and mobile views.
